This document contains the assignment sets of Professor Reza Molavi's ELEC402 Introduction to VLSI Systems. 
ModelSim and Cadence are used to design and analysis the circuit. 

Assignment-1: Systemverilog FSM project

Assignment-2: The synthesize of the FSM

Assignment-3: The verification of MOS transistors using Cadence

Assignment_4: NAND3 Simulation & Layout

Assignment_5: Dynamic circuit and transimission gates

The answers are NOT guaranteed to be correct but MOST of them are correct. If you find any problems, welcome to let me know via email: ruyizhou0711@gmail.com
